Anonymous Function is a community of technology leaders, future and
present, who share information, discuss ideas, and work together to
improve the art and science of leadership.

Diversity is one of our huge strengths, but it can also lead to
communication issues. To support a welcoming environment for all,
regardless of individual differences, we have a few ground rules that
we ask people to adhere to when they participate in this community
activities. These rules apply equally to founders, organizers,
moderators, sponsors, and affiliates – in short, to all participants.

This isn’t an exhaustive list of things that you must do, or can’t
do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it’s intended. It’s a guide
to make it easier to enrich all of us and the technical communities in
which we participate, and which we represent.

## The Principles

**Be friendly and welcoming.** We strive to be a community that
welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This
includes, but is not limited to, members of any race, ethnicity,
culture, national origin, color, immigration status, social and
economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender
identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief,
religion, and mental and physical ability.

**Be respectful.** Not all of us will agree all the time, but
disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might
all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that
frustration to turn into a personal attack. It’s important to remember
that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not
a productive one. Members of the Anonymous Function community should
be respectful when dealing with other members as well as with people
outside the community.

**Be careful in the words that you choose.** We are a community of
professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to
others. Do not insult or put down other participants, individually or
as a group. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren’t
acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:

- Violent threats or language directed against another person.
- Discriminatory jokes and language.
- Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
- Posting (or threatening to post) other people’s personally identifying information (“doxing”).
- Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
- Unwelcome sexual attention.
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
- Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.

## In Case Of Violation

If you believe that someone is violating the code of conduct during
one of our events, please contact a member of the [Anonymous Function
team](/team) immediately.

All reports will be kept confidential. In some cases a public
statement might be required (for example in a CoC transparency report
following events), but these reports are anonymized and do not include
any personally identifying information.

## Thanks

This code of conduct is largely based on the Write The Docs Code of
Conduct, which in turn credits the Django Project Code of Conduct,
which in turn credits the original text of the Speak Up! project,
inspired in its turn by the Fedora Project, as well as the Python
Mentorship Project and many others.
