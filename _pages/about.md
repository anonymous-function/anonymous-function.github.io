**Anonymous Function** is a meetup group for people working in
technology wanting to level-up their leadership skills. Through a
series of talks, workshops, games and mentoring, Anonymous Function
aims to help you progress your career into engineering leadership.

Our community is open to absolutely everybody working within software
engineering; programmers, product specialists, tech writers… The
community is a success because we open-mindedly share and learn from
each others’ experiences: experienced leaders are crucial to the group
because they bring a career of best practice and lessons learned; new
leaders bring a fresh perspective and modern techniques.

Anonymous Function events do not promote any particular leadership
style but, instead, provide an environment in which engineers can
learn for themselves which tools and techniques match their personal
style.
