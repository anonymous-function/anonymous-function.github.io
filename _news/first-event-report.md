title: Event Report. "Designing the Group and its Path Forward"
date: 2017-10-03
---

On Monday, October 2, the group held a kickoff workshop to work out
what is the best path forward for the group: what is our target
audience, why should they care and what content do they want?

There were 10 sign-ups [for the
meeting](https://www.meetup.com/Anonymous-Function/events/243247860),
with 5 in attendance. That'll do nicely for a first meeting.

## The Audience

The big question here is obvious: is this a group for engineers,
people work in tech or anyone and everyone? The orginal intent was
always that this would be a group for people who lead engineers. The
content, of course, would be useful for anyone working in tech. Often,
but not always, the content is posibl of use to absolutely anyone
wanting to level-up their leadership skills.

That is the most important aspect: this group is about creating
opportunities for leaders to level-up their skills. It is not about
creating networking opportunities for existing (senior)
leaders. Berlin is a city where the typical engineer is below 30 in
age, so clearly it is important to provide opportunities to provide
support to these people who are still early in their careers.

We came up with the following as a description of our target group:

> Technologists and related professionals who lead (or want to lead)
> teams and learn new skills.[^1]

## The Approach

Berlin has a lot of groups dedicated to leadership. They all share a
similar problem, they are great forums for spreading knowledge but not
necesarilly about teaching actual skills. This takes pratice.

We summarised our thoughts as:

- Talks: nice
- Workshops better: better
- Sharing experience: best
- Mentoring: bestest[^2]

As a general approach the group agreed to try two specific types of
session to see what really works. The group will agree on a theme for
a month and then run one of each type session on that theme. The two
session types:

- **Practical Workshop**: Introductory talk(s) on the theme followed
   by a practical activity (game, roleplay, similar) where the theory
   is put into practice.
- **Meet & Share**: group members can come and share their experiences
   of the topic and ask for feedback/advice.

## The Content

In two parts, the group performed an exercise where we gathered ideas
for what might make for group topics to cover and we arranged them
into "epics":

These ideas have been included in the [events ideas
board](https://github.com/anonymous-function/events/projects/1?) on
Github. These ideas can easily be converted into issues for
requesting/proposing meetups. For this there is already a template and
a [README](https://github.com/anonymous-function/events) for how to
setup an event.

The eagle-eyed of you will note we have [already started to
plan](https://github.com/anonymous-function/events/issues/2) our first
*real* session for later this month.

What is most important is to start creating a steady, reliably
high-quality series of events which brings people back
repeatedly. Most important, is to build an open community around the
content, where members of the group are activey involved with
suggesting content that might be of value and to even get involved
with event organisation.
