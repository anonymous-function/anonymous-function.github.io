Take a quick look and you will see that Berlin has many
leadership-related meetups. Some are domain-specific, some cater for
leaders from all industries. There is something they almost all have
in common and it is because of this that Anonymous Function exists...

Now this, in itself, is not a bad thing. Leaders sharing experience
and best practice with other leaders is only to be encouraged. But
where is the opportunity to get *into* leadership?

Anonymous Function exists to help develop leadership skills to anyone
working in tech, no matter what their level of experience is.
