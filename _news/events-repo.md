Over time, it is hoped that Lead in Tech will grow into a
thriving community based on openness, honesty and a drive to
better. In order to live our commitment to openness, it is important
that the entire community is encouraged to take part as much as
possible.

With this in mind, Lead in Tech has launched an initiative to
allow community members to either suggest or request events to be
held. In order to achieve this, we have created a [dedicated GitHub
repo](https://github.com/lead-in-tech/events) for containing
issues for the creation of events.

Anyone with a GitHub account is able to create an issue within this
repository. suggesting a future event. All details are provided in the
repo's [README](https://github.com/lead-in-tech/events).
