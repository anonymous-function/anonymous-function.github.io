# Paul Adams

I am passionate about software engineering and software engineers. I
love working with, teaching and learning from other engineers. I have
learned that servant leadership is the finest way to ensure that I get
the most out of my teams: I listen, I teach and I help. I work in
fast-paced environments and build-up a mutual respect with those I
work with by enabling them to work at their best.
