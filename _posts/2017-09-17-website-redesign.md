The original design of the Anonymous Function website
was... errr... minimalist. In order to make things a little more
exciting I have upgraded to the Jekyll "Writer" theme.

The whole website is based upon Jekyll and GitHub Pages, with the
source markdown available [in our
repo](https://github.com/anonymous-function/anonymous-function.github.io). Your
contributions to content/design are totally welcome!
